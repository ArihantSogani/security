C++ Security System Project
A simple console-based security system with user registration, login, and password management functionality built in C++.
Project Overview
This C++ application provides a basic security system with the following features:

User registration with unique username validation
Secure login system
Password change functionality for registered users
Simple file-based user credential storage

Prerequisites
To compile and run this project, you need:

C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
Basic knowledge of terminal/command prompt

Installation

Clone or download all project files to your local machine
Navigate to the project directory in your terminal/command prompt
Compile the source code:
# Using g++
g++ security_system.cpp -o security_system

# Using clang++
clang++ security_system.cpp -o security_system

# Using MSVC (Windows)
cl security_system.cpp

Usage

1.Run the compiled executable:
# On Linux/macOS
./security_system

# On Windows
security_system.exe

2.Follow the on-screen menu to:

Register a new user
Login with existing credentials
Change password for a registered user
Exit the application



Features Explained
Registration

Creates a new user account with username and password
Validates that the username is unique
Stores credentials in a text file (users.txt)

Login

Authenticates users against stored credentials
Provides access to additional functionality upon successful login
Shows appropriate error messages for failed login attempts

Change Password

Allows authenticated users to change their password
Verifies old password before allowing the change
Updates the stored credentials accordingly

File Structure

security_system.cpp: The main source code file
users.txt: Text file where user credentials are stored (created automatically on first registration)

Security Notes
This is a basic implementation meant for educational purposes:

Passwords are stored in plain text (not recommended for production systems)
The cross-platform version does not mask password input
No encryption is used for the credential storage

For a production system, consider implementing:

Password hashing (using libraries like bcrypt)
Encrypted file storage
Proper input validation and sanitization
Session management

Troubleshooting
Common Issues:

File Access Errors:

Ensure the program has read/write permissions to the directory
Check if another process is using the users.txt file


Compilation Errors:

Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed
Verify that all necessary header files are available


Input Handling Issues:

If the program crashes on unexpected input, try the cross-platform version which has better input validation



Extending the Project
Here are some ideas for extending the functionality:

Add user roles (admin, regular user)
Implement password complexity requirements
Add account recovery options
Create a better UI using a C++ GUI library
Implement session timeout functionality
